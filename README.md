## 🔍 What Problem Does QueJI Solve?

In today’s dynamic environments—malls, hospitals, events, offices—traditional CCTV systems fall short. They’re passive, require human monitoring, and often:

- Delay emergency response  
- Fail to manage crowd control and queues  
- Waste valuable data due to lack of real-time processing  

**QueJI flips the script—making security proactive, responsive, and smart.**
